Building model...

Computing reachable states...
 14 states
Reachable states exploration and model construction done in 0.014 secs.
Sorting reachable states list...

Time for model construction: 0.016 seconds.
Building reward structure...
Computing rewards...
Starting expected reachability...
Starting Prob1 (maxmin)...
Prob1 (maxmin) took 5 iterations and 0.0 seconds.
target=4, inf=0, rest=10
Computing the upper bound where 0.11 is used instead of 0.0
Starting value iteration (minmax)...
Value iteration (minmax) took 5 iterations and 0.0 seconds.
Computed an over-approximation of the solution (in 0 seconds), this will now be used to get the solution
Starting value iteration (minmax)...
Value iteration (minmax) took 5 iterations and 0.001 seconds.
Expected reachability took 0.002 seconds.

Value in the initial state: 4.5

Time for model checking: 0.006 seconds.

Result: 4.5 (value in the initial state)
